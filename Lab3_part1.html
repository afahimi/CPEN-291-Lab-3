                      L.R Linares is an Associate Professor Teaching in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UBC. He is a Musician, Professional Engineer, Consultant, Moviemaker and Teacher. From the National Music Conservatory to UBC, his life has combined a healthy mix of science, arts, and good common sense (that is, industrial engineering experience). Three of his degrees are in engineering (the most recent of which was his PhD from UBC). The Killam Teaching Prize stands out among his other recognitions, as a testimony to his passion for teaching. Modeling and simulation of engineering systems, and their computer implementation, have occupied his research activities for the past few years. He is a passionate, and not a too shabby skier, and has been trying, unsuccessfully, to learn Kung-Fu and Karate for several decades.

                  When people ask Luis Linares why he spends days upon days putting together his videos and making them available to the whole planet for free, his response goes along the lines of "I started doing this a few years ago, and never looked back. I think it is the right thing to do. To share what little we may know. It goes along the same way as Wikipedia, but within the realm of expertise of each person, and in a conversational tone, with the apparent proximity of the video. It is an open invitation to others to do the same. To share what they know and love with the world." For Luis, it is important to share knowledge and information freely, and to encourage others to do the same. His videos are a way to make expertise accessible and approachable for everyone.

              <p>At the end of the day, I retreat to my dorm room, where I struggle to fall asleep and often find myself plagued by anxious thoughts and feelings of inadequacy. I know that tomorrow will bring new challenges, and the cycle will begin again. It's a difficult way to live, but I hold onto hope that one day, things will get better.
